        Whether you want to bring your business online, launch an online store, or show off your portfolio to the world, Wix has a template for you.
In fact, with more than 800 templates to choose from, Wix is one of the best website builders to create just about any website that you can imagine.
</p>

<p>All of Wix’s themes are professionally designed and beautiful to look at. They’re also easy to work with when you’re building your website and straightforward for visitors to navigate. You don’t need any design experience to launch a site with Wix—just choose a template, customize the content, and publish your site. The whole process takes as little as a few minutes.

In this guide, we cover everything that you need to know about Wix templates, including how much they cost and how you can customize them. We also highlight 10 of the best Wix templates of 2022 and explain what makes them stand out.

Free Wix Templates
One of the great things about Wix is that all 800 of the platform’s templates are included free with your website. Whether you’re using a free Wix plan or paying for premium features, you can choose from the entire complement of Wix themes.

However, if you do use Wix for free—as opposed to paying to upgrade your plan—there are a few limitations to be aware of. These include:
</p>
<p>
There’s a maximum of 500MB of storage.
There’s a maximum of 500MB of bandwidth each month.
Visitors will see the Wix logo and ads for Wix on your site.
You cannot add your own domain (i.e., your website will be [yoursitename].wix.com).
In addition, it’s important to note that you cannot sell products with a free Wix website. So, while you’ll have access to ecommerce templates to build your site, you won’t be able to add products to your pages.
</p>

Wix Premium Templates
Since all Wix templates are free, there aren’t any “premium” templates that you need to pay for. That said, it’s worth understanding how Wix’s pricing structure works so you know how to unlock additional customization features.

The cheapest Wix premium plan, Combo, costs $14 per month. It increases your storage space to 3GB, eliminates Wix branding on your website, and enables you to add your own domain. 

If you want to use one of Wix’s ecommerce templates to launch an online store, you’ll need to upgrade to the Business Basic plan. This costs $23 per month and enables you to sell an unlimited number of products.

In the unlikely event that none of Wix’s 800 templates suit your needs, you can turn to third-party template providers to find custom Wix themes. For example, WixProThemes offers paid Wix themes starting at $149. You can also turn to an alternative website builder like Squarespace, which is renowned for its stunning and highly customizable templates.
